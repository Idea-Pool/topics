# Open Source

The Open Source stream is an initiative that aims to cultivate a deeper appreciation for Open Source culture among engineers. Through this program, participants can gain valuable development experience and make meaningful contributions to the global Open Source community.

By joining the Open Source stream, you can enjoy a range of benefits, including:
* Experience with end-to-end software development practices, from planning and design to development, testing, release, and maintenance.
* The opportunity to make meaningful contributions to the Open Source community, and thereby gain recognition and visibility for your work.
* Access to a network of experienced Open Source contributors who can help you bring your software ideas to life.

At Idea Pool community, we understand that Open Source development can be challenging, especially for those who are new to the field. That's why we offer a range of resources to support you throughout your journey, including:
* Assistance with starting a new Open Source project or validating an idea before diving into development.
* Guidance on best practices for releasing, maintaining, and contributing to Open Source projects.
* Help with finding interesting Open Source projects to contribute to, so you can build your skills and expand your portfolio. 

We believe that Open Source development is a valuable and rewarding pursuit, and we're proud to support our community in this endeavor. Whether you're an experienced developer or just getting started, we invite you to join us in exploring the limitless possibilities of Open Source development.

## Our Open Source projects

Our community has launched several successful Open Source projects in recent years, offering ideal starting points for those looking to begin their Open Source journey.

In addition to our current portfolio, we're excited to announce that we have several new projects in the pipeline, set to launch in the near future. Stay tuned for updates on these exciting new initiatives.

### GherKing

> GherKing is a powerful tool that enhances the functionality of Gherkin, making it a smarter and more efficient way to handle Cucumber/Gherkin feature files programmatically within your JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.

Launched by a team of talented engineers in 2017, the GherKing project has since become a leading example of best practices in Open Source and Node.js library development.

Currently in progress, GherKing is available on the Node.js/NPM platform and consists of 16 NPM packages, with over **40k downloads** per week.

To learn more about this exciting project and how it can benefit your development workflow, visit the GherKing repository on GitHub at https://github.com/gherking.

### Community Manager

> The Community Manager is a tool...

We plan to start this project, to migrate our internal community management processes to the cloud. We plan to use this project as an all-inclusive project, to exercise an E2E development flow of a more complex, cloud-based application.

* Status: Under planning
* Project: https://github.com/Idea-Pool/topics/issues/38
* Platform: AWS/Serverless/TypeScript

### AWS Testing

> The AWS Testing guide aims to provide an overview of the testing practices that can be adapted to testing in the cloud, specifically in AWS, and to offer best practices and tips for effective testing.

Our goal with this project was twofold:
1. First of all, we wanted to make a comprehensive guide about the testing practices in AWS.
2. Secondly, we wanted to experiment with the development of open source and public-hosted learning materials.

* Status: In progress
* Project: https://github.com/orgs/Idea-Pool/projects/2/views/1
* Page: https://aws-testing.ideapool.community/
* Platform: Node.js/AWS/GitHub Actions

### AWS Allure

TBD
