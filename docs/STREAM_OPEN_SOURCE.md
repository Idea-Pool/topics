# Open Source

The Open Source stream is an initiative that aims to cultivate a deeper appreciation for Open Source culture among engineers in cooperation with TBD. Through contribution to this stream, participants can gain valuable development experience and supported to make meaningful contributions to the global Open Source community.

By joining the Open Source stream, you can enjoy a range of benefits, including:
* Experience with end-to-end software development practices, from planning and design to development, testing, release, and maintenance.
* The opportunity to make meaningful contributions to the Open Source community.
* Opportunity to work with experienced Open Source contributors who can help you bring your software ideas to life.

At Idea Pool community, we understand that Open Source development can be challenging, especially for those who are new to the field. That's why we offer a range of resources to support you throughout your journey, including:
* Assistance with starting a new Open Source project or validating an idea before diving into development.
* Guidance on best practices for releasing, maintaining, and contributing to Open Source projects.
* Help with finding interesting Open Source projects to contribute to, so you can build your skills and expand your portfolio. 

We believe that Open Source development is a valuable and rewarding pursuit, and we're proud to support our community in this endeavor. Whether you're an experienced developer or just getting started, we invite you to join us in exploring the limitless possibilities of Open Source development.

## Projects

Our community has launched several successful Open Source projects in recent years, offering ideal starting points for those looking to begin their Open Source journey.

In addition to our current portfolio (a few of these following), we have several new projects in the pipeline, set to launch in the near future.

### GherKing

> GherKing is a powerful tool that enhances the functionality of Gherkin, making it a smarter and more efficient way to handle Cucumber/Gherkin feature files programmatically within your JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.

Launched by a team of talented engineers in 2017, the GherKing project has since become a leading example of best practices in Open Source and Node.js library development.

Currently in progress, GherKing is available on the Node.js/NPM platform and consists of 16 NPM packages, with over **40k downloads** per week.

To learn more about this exciting project and how it can benefit your development workflow, read our [GherKing - Idea Pool Projects](https://wearecommunity.io/communities/idea-pool/articles/306) article and visit the [GherKing repository on GitHub](https://github.com/gherking).

### Community Manager

> The Community Manager is a comprehensive tool designed to assist communities in efficiently managing administration, governance, value stream, recognition, and reporting processes.

As part of our ongoing efforts to streamline and modernize our internal community management practices, we are excited to announce the upcoming launch of the Community Manager project. This initiative serves as a flagship project, showcasing an end-to-end development flow for a sophisticated, cloud-based application.

Currently in the planning phase, the Community Manager project will be implemented utilizing industry-leading technologies such as AWS, Serverless, and TypeScript, ensuring a scalable and robust solution.

To explore this exciting opportunity further and get involved, please visit the [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Idea-Pool/topics/issues/38) dedicated to the Community Manager project. Stay tuned for updates as we progress towards the official launch!

### AWS Testing

> The AWS Testing Guide is a comprehensive resource that provides an in-depth overview of testing practices tailored specifically for the cloud, with a focus on AWS. This guide aims to equip developers and testing professionals with best practices, valuable insights, and practical tips for effective testing in AWS environments.

Our project pursued two primary objectives:

1. Firstly, we aimed to create an extensive guide that covers a wide range of testing practices within the AWS ecosystem. This guide serves as a valuable reference for both beginners and experienced practitioners seeking to enhance their testing capabilities in AWS.
2. Secondly, we sought to explore the development of open-source, publicly-hosted learning materials. By making this guide openly available, we aim to foster knowledge sharing and collaboration within the testing community.

The AWS Testing Guide project is currently in progress and actively being developed. To track our progress and contribute to the project, please visit the [project page on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/Idea-Pool/projects/2/views/1). Additionally, you can access the guide directly at [aws-testing.ideapool.community](https://aws-testing.ideapool.community/).

As part of this project, we also delivered the [aws-cdk-assert](https://github.com/Idea-Pool/aws-cdk-assert) library that gives handy utilities to test AWS CDK Stack, with predefined test constructs for certain CDK constructs. 

We're excited to provide this valuable resource to the testing community and invite you to join us on this journey of improving testing practices in AWS.
