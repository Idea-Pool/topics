In the **Idea Pool Community**, we organize our processes around the following **value stream**:

![Idea Pool Value Stream](./uml/value_stream.svg)

## Idea

The very bases of our value stream are the ideas. Anyone can propose an **idea** (topic) that should be covered by the community.

An idea can be for example a topic to research more, an idea for a small software, or anything interesting, as long as it provides **professional benefit** or **advantage** to the possible target audience or the participants.

Each idea should have the following attributes:
* **Title** - Concise title or description of the idea.
* **Details** - An extended, detailed description of the idea, including **goals**, **benefits**, **planned tasks**, etc.
* **Area** - The professional area to which the area belongs, e.g. Test Automation.
* **Stream(s)** - To which stream the idea belongs or is intended. An idea can belong to multiple streams.
* **Format(s)** - In which format the idea should be covered, based on the formats available for the stream. An idea can be realized in multiple formats.
* **Artifact(s)** - The planned or delivered artifacts connected to the idea, based on the artifacts and the formats available/assigned to it. In the scope of an idea, multiple artifacts can be delivered.

The **title** of the idea is only mandatory when proposing a new one. However, providing the rest of the attributes (at least the **details**) of the idea is highly welcome to have a better understanding of it.

Each of these ideas is managed as an **issue** in the [topics][topics] repository.

## Area

All of the ideas belong to at least one of the professional **areas**.

Such areas can be:
* Software Development
* Testing
* Test Automation
* General
* Soft Skills

The area(s) of a given idea is marked with the `area:{name}` labels on the issue of the idea, e.g. `area:test-automation`.

## Stream

All of the ideas and activities belong to one of our **streams**. A **stream** is a group of activities with a shared goal.

Each stream is defined by
* the **Name** of the stream,
* the **Goal** the stream aims to achieve,
* the **Benefits** the stream delivers, and
* the **Owner** who mainly governs the stream.

The stream(s) of a given idea is marked with the `stream:{name}` labels on the issue of the idea, e.g. `stream:education`.

### Education

- [ ] Rename

* The **goal** of the **Education stream** is to assist the development of engineers by providing help, opportunities, and materials to learn, educate, to share experiences and best practices.
* The **benefits** of participating in the Education stream include
  * ...

For more information about the stream, please turn to [Milan Horvath][milan].

### Open Source

* The **goal** of the **Open Source stream** is to deepen Open Source culture within engineers and allow them to gather development experience and contribute to the Open Source Community.
* The **benefits** of participating in the Open Source stream include
  * Gathering experience with E2E software development practices, including planning, design, development, testing, release, and maintenance.
  * Contributing to the global Open Source Community.
  * Realizing software ideas with the help of experienced Open Source contributors.

For more information about the stream, please turn to [Laszlo Szikszai][szikszail].

### Cloud

* The **goal** of the **Cloud stream** is to aid engineers to extend their knowledge and gather experience with cloud technologies, platforms, and SDLC processes adapted to it.
* The **benefits** of participating in the Cloud stream include
  * Gathering practical experience with cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP) and connected technologies.
  * Being able to adapt the standard SDLC practices to the cloud, such as development and testing.

For more information about the stream, please turn to [Laszlo Szikszai][szikszail].

### Test Automation Tool Evaluation (TA Tool Evaluation)

* The **goal** of the **TA Tool Evaluation stream** is to...
* The **benefits** of participating in the TA Tool Evaluation stream include
  * ...

For more information about the stream, please turn to [Sandor Orosz][sorosz].

## Format

Any idea can be realized in one of our **formats** which are approaches and processes to produce results of a stream.

Each format is defined by
* the **Name** of the format,
* the **Process** the format uses to produce its artifacts,
* the **Artifact(s)** produced by the format,
* the **Template(s)** for the artifacts specific to this format, and
* the **Owner** who mainly maintains the format.

The format(s) of a given idea is marked with the `format:{name}` labels on the issue of the idea, e.g. `format:workshop`.

### Workshop

In the **workshop** format, a primarily offline event is organized, to cover the idea.

The main process of this format:

![Workshop-Process](./assets/process-placeholder.png).

As the result of a workshop, the following artifacts might be created:
 - An [article](#article) to describe the workshop and its outcome,
 - A [meetup](#meetup) and a [talk](#talk) to organize the workshop,
 - A [video](#video) recording if the workshop is held online.

For more information about the format, please turn to [Sandor Orosz][sorosz].

### Webinar

In the **TBD** format, TBD, to cover the idea.

The main process of this format:

![Workshop-Process](./assets/process-placeholder.png).

As the result of a TBD, the following artifacts might be created:
 - [TBD](#tbd)

For more information about the format, please turn to [Laszlo Szikszai][szikszail].

### Minutes

## Artifact

The **artifacts** are achievable and presentable results produced in the scope of an idea that demonstrates information.

Each artifact (type) is defined by
* the **Name** of the artifact,
* the **Author(s)** created the artifact,
* the actual **Content** of the artifact,
* the **Location** of the artifact, and
* the **Analytics** of view/review of the artifact.

The artifact(s) of a given idea is marked with the `artifact:{name}` labels on the issue of the idea, e.g. `artifact:video`.

### Meetup

A meetup directly maps to an **event** on the [WeAreCommunity][wearecommunity] page, for example: [AI based image generation with OpenAI's DALL-E API][event].

Meetups can have different formats, including: Tech-Talk, Demo, Workshop, etc.

### Talk

A talk directly maps to a **talk** on the [WeAreCommunity][wearecommunity] page, as part of an event, for example: [AI based image generation with OpenAI's DALL-E API][talk].

### Video

A video is an audio-visual artifact that can be either a **recording** of a talk (for example: [AI-based image generation with OpenAI's DALL-E API][recoring]), or a **manually recording/edited** video/movie (for example: [NPM Semantic Versioning][minutes]).

All our video hosted on [VideoPortal][videoportal], and synchronized to [WeAreCommunity][wearecommunity].

### Article

An article directly maps to an **article** on the [WeAreCommunity][wearecommunity] page, for example: [Story telling - Team SSG - Hackathon experience][article].

### Software

A software can be either a **source code** (for example: [evaluation-request-interception][sourcecode]) or the **delivered software** (for example: aws-cdk-assert [Source][packagesource]/[NPM][packagenpm]) as well to any artifactory/repostory (e.g. NPM, PyPi).

For each software, we usually create a separate repository ([aws-cdk-assert][packagesource]) or project/organization ([GherKing][gherking]), depending on its size.

### Site

A site is either a **static web-page** or a dynamic web-application created and hosted either on **GitHub Pages** or on the **Idea Pool Domain** (for example: [AWS Testing][awstesting]).

A site is always a **software** as well, thus similar processes can apply to it as for the software artifact (e.g. creating a repository, or setting up a project).
