In the **Idea Pool Community**, we organized our processes around the following **value stream**:

![Idea Pool Value Stream](./assets/IdeaPool_ValueStream.png)

## Topic

The very base of our value stream is the topics. Anyone can propose a **topic** or an **idea** that should be covered by the community. Such a topic should provide professional benefit or advantage to the possible target audience or the participants.

Each topic should have the following attributes:
* **Title** - Concise title or description of the topic.
* **Details** - Extended, detailed description of the topic, including **goals**, **benefits**, **planned tasks**, etc.
* **Stream(s)** - To which stream the topic belongs or intended. A topic can belong to multiple streams.
* **Format(s)** - In which format the topic should be covered, based on the formats available for the stream. A topic can be realized in multiple formats.
* **Artifact(s)** - The planned or delivered artifacts connected to the topic, based on the artifacts and the formats available/assigned to the topic. In scope of a topic, multiple artifacts can be delivered.

The **title** of the topic is only mandatory when proposing a new topic, however, providing the **details** of the topic is highly welcome to have a better understanding of the topic.

## Stream

All of the topics and activities belong to one of our **streams**. A **stream** is a group of activities with a shared goal.

Each stream is defined by
* the **Name** of the stream,

* the **Benefits** the stream delivers, and
* the **Owner** who mainly governs the stream.
