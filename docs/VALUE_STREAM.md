In the **Idea Pool Community**, we organized our processes around the following **value stream**:

![Idea Pool Value Stream](./assets/IdeaPool_ValueStream.png)

## Idea

The very bases of our value stream are the ideas. Anyone can propose an **idea** (topic) that should be covered by the community.

An idea can be for example a topic to research more, an idea for a small software, or anything interesting, as long as it provides **professional benefit** or **advantage** to the possible target audience or the participants.

Each idea should have the following attributes:
* **Title** - Concise title or description of the idea.
* **Details** - An extended, detailed description of the idea, including **goals**, **benefits**, **planned tasks**, etc.
* **Area** - The professional area to which the area belongs, e.g. Test Automation.
* **Stream(s)** - To which stream the idea belongs or is intended. An idea can belong to multiple streams.
* **Format(s)** - In which format the idea should be covered, based on the formats available for the stream. An idea can be realized in multiple formats.
* **Artifact(s)** - The planned or delivered artifacts connected to the idea, based on the artifacts and the formats available/assigned to it. In the scope of an idea, multiple artifacts can be delivered.

The **title** of the idea is only mandatory when proposing a new one. However, providing the rest of the attributes (at least the **details**) of the idea is highly welcome to have a better understanding of it.

Each of these ideas is managed as an **issue** in the topics[^topics] repository.

## Area

All of the ideas belong to at least one of the professional **areas**.

Such areas can be:
* Software Development
* Testing
* Test Automation
* General
* Soft Skills

The area(s) of a given idea is marked with the `area:{name}` labels on the issue of the idea, e.g. `area:test-automation`.

## Stream

All of the ideas and activities belong to one of our **streams**. A **stream** is a group of activities with a shared goal.

Each stream is defined by
* the **Name** of the stream,
* the **Goal** the stream aims to achieve,
* the **Benefits** the stream delivers, and
* the **Owner** who mainly governs the stream.

The stream(s) of a given idea is marked with the `stream:{name}` labels on the issue of the idea, e.g. `stream:education`.

### Education

* The **goal** of the **Education stream** is to assist the development of engineers by providing help, opportunities, and materials to learn, educate, to share experiences and best practices.
* The **benefits** of participating in the Education stream include

## Format

Any idea can be realized in one of our **formats** which are approaches and processes to produce results of a stream.

Each format is defined by
* the **Name** of the format,
* the **Process** the format uses to produce its artifacts,
* the **Artifact(s)** produced by the format,
* the **Template(s)** for the artifacts specific to this format, and
* the **Owner** who mainly maintains the format.

The format(s) of a given idea is marked with the `format:{name}` labels on the issue of the idea, e.g. `format:workshop`.
