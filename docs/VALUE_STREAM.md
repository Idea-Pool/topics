In the **Idea Pool Community**, we organized our processes around the following **value stream**:

![Idea Pool Value Stream](./assets/IdeaPool_ValueStream.png)

## Topic

The very base of our value stream is the topics. Anyone can propose a **topic** or an **idea** that should be covered by the community. Such a topic should provide professional benefit or advantage to the possible target audience or the participants.

Each topic should have the following attributes:
* **Title** - Concise title or description of the topic.
* **Details** - Extended, detailed description of the topic, including **goals**, **benefits**, **planned tasks**, etc.
* **Stream(s)** - To which stream the topic belongs or intended. A topic can belong to multiple streams.
* **Format(s)** - In which format the topic should be covered, based on the formats available for the stream. A topic can be realized in multiple formats.
* **Artifact(s)** - The planned or delivered artifacts connected to the topic, based on the artifacts and the formats available/assigned to the topic. In the scope of a topic, multiple artifacts can be delivered.

The **title** of the topic is only mandatory when proposing a new topic, however, providing the **details** of the topic is highly welcome to have a better understanding of the topic.

## Stream

All of the topics and activities belong to one of our **streams**. A **stream** is a group of activities with a shared goal.

Each stream is defined by
* the **Name** of the stream,
* the **Goal** the stream aims to achieve,
* the **Benefits** the stream delivers, and
* the **Owner** who mainly governs the stream.

The stream(s) of a given topic is marked with the `stream:{name}` labels, e.g. `stream:education`.

### Education

* The **goal** of the **Education stream** is to assist engineers in their self-development by providing opportunities, and materials, and sharing experiences and best practices.
* The **benefits** of participating in the Education stream include

### Open Source

* The **goal** of the **Open Source stream** is to deepen Open Source culture within engineers and allow them to gather development experience and contribute to the Open Source Community.
* The **benefits** of participating in the Open Source stream include
  * Gathering experience with E2E software development practices, including planning, design, development, testing, release, and maintenance.
  * Contributing to the global Open Source Community.
  * Realizing software ideas with the help of experienced Open Source contributors.

## Format

Any topic can be realized in one of our **formats** which are approaches and processes to produce results of a stream.

Each format is defined by
* the **Name** of the format,
* the **Process** the format uses to produce its artifacts,
* the **Artifact(s)** produced by the format,
* the **Template(s)** for the artifacts specific to this format, and
* the **Owner** who mainly maintains the format.

The format(s) of a given topic is marked with the `format:{name}` labels, e.g. `format:education`.

### Workshop

In the **workshop** format, a primarily offline event is organized, to cover the topic.

The main process of this format: ![Workshop-Process](./assets/process-placeholder.png).

As the result of a workshop, the following artifacts might be created:
 - An [article](#article) to describe the workshop and its outcome,
 - A [meetup](#meetup) and a [talk](#talk) to organize the workshop,
 - A [video](#video) recording if the workshop is held online.

* the **Name** of the artifact,

* the actual **Content** of the artifact,
* the **Location** of the artifact, and
